\subsection*{1. Understand the Quantity of Interest (QoI)}
The quantity of interest is the \textbf{tip displacement} at the free end (\(x = L\), \(y = H/2\)) of a 2D cantilever beam under uniform downward traction. The analytical solution is based on the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory: \(w(L) = \frac{q L^4}{8 E I}\), adjusted for plane strain with \(E_{\text{eff}} = \frac{E}{1 - \nu^2}\), where \(q\) is the load, \(L\) is the length, \(E\) is Young's modulus, and \(I = \frac{H^3}{12}\) is the moment of inertia.

\subsection*{2. Compare Numerical and Analytical Results}
The results are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{FEA tip deflection}: \(-0.000429\),
    \item \textbf{Analytical deflection}: \(-0.001365\).
\end{itemize}
The FEA result is smaller than the analytical solution, indicating a discrepancy that needs investigation.

\subsection*{3. Validate the Results}
To validate:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Check Assumptions}: The analytical solution assumes small, linear deformations, but the hyperelastic solver may introduce nonlinear effects. Ensure the solver behaves linearly for small deformations.
    \item \textbf{Mesh Convergence}: The mesh (\(nx = 4\), \(ny = 2\)) is coarse. Increase the number of elements (e.g., \(nx = 8\), \(ny = 4\)) and check if the FEA result approaches the analytical solution.
    \item \textbf{Material Properties}: Verify that \(\mu = 38461.538\) and \(\kappa = 83333.333\) are correctly interpreted by the solver for plane strain.
    \item \textbf{Solver Convergence}: The solver converges (residual \(1.666052 \times 10^{-12}\)), but the discrepancy suggests issues with the model setup, not convergence.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Inputs for the Example}
You provided a 2D cantilever beam setup with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Geometry}: Length \(L = 10.0\), height \(H = 1.0\), mesh with \(nx = 4\), \(ny = 2\), using 4-node quadrilateral elements (\(ele_type = \text{"D2\_nn4\_quad"}\)).
    \item \textbf{Material}: \(E = 100000.0\), \(\nu = 0.3\), yielding \(\mu = 38461.538\), \(\kappa = 83333.333\).
    \item \textbf{Loading}: Uniform downward traction \(q = -0.01\) on the top edge, left edge clamped.
    \item \textbf{Solver}: Hyperelastic solver with 1 load step (\(nr_num_steps = 1\)), tolerance \(1 \times 10^{-10}\), max iterations 30.
\end{itemize}
