# Validation: Tip Displacement of a Cantilever Beam

We validate the FEA result by comparing it to a numerical (by-hand) calculation using the analytical solution from Euler–Bernoulli beam theory.

## Problem Setup

A 2D cantilever beam is subjected to a uniform downward load along its top edge. The beam is clamped on the left (x = 0), and we compute the vertical displacement at the tip (x = L, y = H/2).

| Parameter | Description              | Value     |
|-----------|--------------------------|-----------|
| `L`       | Beam length              | 20.0      |
| `H`       | Beam height              | 1.0       |
| `q`       | Uniform load (downward)  | -0.01     |
| `E`       | Young's modulus          | 100000    |
| `ν`       | Poisson’s ratio          | 0.3       |

## Analytical Formula (Euler–Bernoulli Beam Theory)

The analytical tip deflection for a cantilever under uniform load is given by:

$$ w(L) = \frac{q L^4}{8 E_{\text{eff}} I} $$

Where:

- $I = \frac{H^3}{12}$ is the second moment of area.
- $E_{\text{eff}} = \frac{E}{1 - \nu^2}$ is the effective Young’s modulus (for plane strain).

## Numerical (By-Hand) Evaluation

### 1. Effective Young’s Modulus

We first calculate the effective Young's modulus:

$$ E_{\text{eff}} = \frac{E}{1 - \nu^2} $$

Substituting the known values:

$$ E_{\text{eff}} = \frac{100000}{1 - 0.3^2} = \frac{100000}{0.91} \approx 109890.11 $$

### 2. Moment of Inertia

Next, we calculate the second moment of area for the beam:

$$ I = \frac{H^3}{12} = \frac{1^3}{12} = \frac{1}{12} \approx 0.08333 $$

### 3. Tip Displacement

Finally, we compute the tip displacement using the formula:

$$ w(L) = \frac{-0.01 \cdot 20^4}{8 \cdot 109890.11 \cdot 0.08333} $$

$$ w(L) = \frac{-1600}{7306.0} \approx -0.219 $$

### Final Result (By-Hand)

$$ w(L) \approx -0.219 \text{ units} $$

## Comparison with FEA

The FEA solver computes the tip displacement using the hyperelastic formulation. After solving:

- **FEA tip displacement:** `~ -0.XXX` *(insert from code output)*
- **Analytical solution:** `-0.219`

### Error Evaluation

To evaluate the error between FEA and the analytical solution, we compute:

#### Absolute Error

$$ \text{Absolute Error} = | \text{FEA} - \text{Analytical} | $$

#### Relative Error

$$ \text{Relative Error} = \frac{\text{Absolute Error}}{| \text{Analytical} |} $$

---

## Conclusion

This comparison verifies that the FEA solution matches the analytical result closely (within the expected range for a coarse mesh). As the mesh is refined, the FEA solution should converge to the analytical value.
