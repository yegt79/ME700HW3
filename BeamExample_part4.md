### 1. Understand the Quantity of Interest (QoI)
The quantity of interest is the **tip displacement** at the free end ($x = L$, $y = H/2$) of a 2D cantilever beam under uniform downward traction. The analytical solution is based on the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory: $w(L) = \frac{q L^4}{8 E I}$, adjusted for plane strain with $E_{\text{eff}} = \frac{E}{1 - \nu^2}$, where $q$ is the load, $L$ is the length, $E$ is Young's modulus, and $I = \frac{H^3}{12}$ is the moment of inertia.

### 2. Compare Numerical and Analytical Results
The results are:
- **FEA tip deflection**: -0.000429,
- **Analytical deflection**: -0.001365.

The FEA result is smaller than the analytical solution, indicating a discrepancy that needs investigation.

### 3. Validate the Results
To validate:
- **Check Assumptions**: The analytical solution assumes small, linear deformations, but the hyperelastic solver may introduce nonlinear effects. Ensure the solver behaves linearly for small deformations.
- **Mesh Convergence**: The mesh ($nx = 4$, $ny = 2$) is coarse. Increase the number of elements (e.g., $nx = 8$, $ny = 4$) and check if the FEA result approaches the analytical solution.
- **Material Properties**: Verify that $\mu = 38461.538$ and $\kappa = 83333.333$ are correctly interpreted by the solver for plane strain.
- **Solver Convergence**: The solver converges (residual $1.666052 \times 10^{-12}$), but the discrepancy suggests issues with the model setup, not convergence.

### Inputs for the Example
You provided a 2D cantilever beam setup with:
- **Geometry**: Length $L = 10.0$, height $H = 1.0$, mesh with $nx = 4$, $ny = 2$, using 4-node quadrilateral elements (`ele_type = "D2_nn4_quad"`).
- **Material**: $E = 100000.0$, $\nu = 0.3$, yielding $\mu = 38461.538$, $\kappa = 83333.333$.
- **Loading**: Uniform downward traction $q = -0.01$ on the top edge, left edge clamped.
- **Solver**: Hyperelastic solver with 1 load step ($nr_num_steps = 1$), tolerance $1 \times 10^{-10}$, max iterations 30.
